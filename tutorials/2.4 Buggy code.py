# Serena's metal sheet construction code.
# Change these as you want (I should probably use `input` for these!)
l = 4
w = 6

# Double the length
w = l * 2

# Get the perimeter of this doubled sheet
perimeter = 2 * w + 2 * l

# Get the area
area = w * l

# Print the sum
# This should be 52 with the l=4 and w=6 :(
print(area * perimeter)
